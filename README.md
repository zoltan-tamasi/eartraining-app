Ear-training app
================
This project has started out as a double-experiment on one side to 
try out the [Binding.scala](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/Binding.scala) 
library, and find out how easy it is to develop browser based applications with 
it, especially compared to React/Redux, and on the other side this a music-theory
experimentation as well about [trichords](https://medium.com/@tzoltan84/a-rediscovery-of-trichords-part-1-d22388a707d8) 
and how easy it is to recognize different kinds of them.

Build and start
=================
To build the project you'll need SBT:

```
sbt fastOptJS
```

And then you can use npm to install an http-server and serve the files at `http://localhost:8080` 
```
npm install
npm start
```
